# The include keyword must be unquoted and followed by a quoted URL or file path.
# File paths should be absolute or relative to the script's working directory, not the HOCON file location.
# This "aaosa.hocon" file contains key-value pairs used for substitution.
# Specifically, it provides values for the following keys:
#   - aaosa_call
#   - aaosa_command
#   - aaosa_instructions
# IMPORTANT:
# Ensure that you run `python -m run` from the top level of the repository.
# The path to this substitution file is **relative to the top-level directory**,
# so running the script from elsewhere may result in file not found errors.
